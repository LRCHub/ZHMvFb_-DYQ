Though you say we're through
I'll always love you
And you can depend on me
Though someone that you've met
Has made you forget Honey, you know
You can count on me When I wish, I wish you success

And loads, loads of happiness But baby,
I gotta confess I'll be lonely If you ever,
Ahh, if you ever need a friend
And you can depend on me
I'll be yours until the end

And loads of happiness
I wish you success
But, darling, I gotta confess I'm gonna be lonely
Oh if you ever, ahh, if you ever need a friend
I'll be right by your side ahh, till the end
And you can depend on me You can depend on me
